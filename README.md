# Restaurant Reviews App
The Restaurant Reviews App is the seventh project for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001">Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree</a>.

## About the Responsive Portfolio Page
The Restaurant Reviews App is to show my skills with responsive design of a web page and implementing service worker caching.

## Project Files
This page requires the following (all included within the repository):
* HTML files (index.html, restaurant.html)
* CSS file (styles.css)
* JavaScript files (dbhelper.js, main.js, restaurant_info.js)
* Service Worker (sw.js)
* JSON file (restaurants.json)
* Images (images within the 'img' folder)

## Instructions
To work with the files:
1. Click on the 'Clone or download' button.
2. Press the 'Download ZIP' button
3. Unzip the files on your computer
4. Open the index.html file within an Internet browser

Alternatively, if you have GitHub installed:
1. Click on the 'Clone or download' button.
2. Copy the github .git URL file (e.g. git@github.com:git-andrewjlim/fend-nanodegree-restaurant-review-app.git)
3. Navigate to your GitHub repository location on your computer
4. In your console type 'git clone ' and paste the .git URL
```
git@github.com:git-andrewjlim/fend-nanodegree-restaurant-review-app.git
```
5. Open dbhelper.js and uncomment port and local host return statement.
6. Start a local host server, by following the following instructions:
    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
7. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
